# 🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis

This project explores a global climate change dataset sourced from Kaggle
. The goal is to analyze and visualize climate-related metrics across countries and years to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help shape policies for combating climate change.

# 📌 Project Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on climate indicators.

Identify relationships and correlations among climate metrics.

Explore trends over time such as rising CO₂ emissions, temperature changes, and renewable energy adoption.

Provide actionable insights for policymakers and environmental organizations.

Keep the focus on interpretability (no machine learning models used).

# 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multiple climate-related indicators across countries and years.

Key Columns:

Year → Year of data point

Country → Country/region name

Average Temperature (°C) → Annual average temperature

CO2 Emissions (Tons/Capita) → Per capita carbon emissions

Sea Level Rise (mm) → Annual sea level rise

Rainfall (mm) → Total annual rainfall

Population → Total population

Renewable Energy (%) → Share of energy from renewable sources

Extreme Weather Events → Count of events (storms, floods, etc.)

Forest Area (%) → Percentage of land covered by forests

# ⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas → Data manipulation

NumPy → Numerical analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly → Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive analysis

📈 Example Analyses
